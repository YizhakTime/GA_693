This is the repository holding my code for CSCI 693
list_teams.txt records which date, game, stats, and teams I grabbed data from so I don't double count matches or teams

Also, data.csv holds all match data and soccer_ga.py is the code file for this research where it prompts user input for 
a case (experiment to run) where it has 3 different experiments, I did not end up using case 3 which uses less generations, I only
used case 1 (twice) for when I had data for entire month of January and when I had data for January and Februaru 2014, and case 2 which changes parameters of genetic algorithm
